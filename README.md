# Roy Huang ☀ 🌙

Hi I'm Roy (He/Him), a freshman currently studying computer science @ UC Berkeley. I am from Vancouver, BC and am staying there for a while due to remote classes. Here in the pins, I have some projects that I dabbled with. Currently, I am learning full-stack web dev while working with [IEEEBerkeley](https://github.com/IEEEBerkeley). In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with LinuxOS 🐧, PC building 🖥, and grooving to good music 🎵.
